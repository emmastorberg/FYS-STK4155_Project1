There is currently a to-do list in Overleaf. In later stages we can just have it here:

## To-do part a):
-  rewrite mse and r2 as our own implementation, not sklearn
-  COMMENT WHAT SCALING WE USED AND WHY
-  fix wonky labeling in parameter plot

## To-do part b)
- make plots of ridge regression wrt changes in lambda, not just polydegree.
- write about comparisons to ols

## General to-do
- make design matrix for multivariable functions
-  change data generation to generate franke function instead of an exponential function
