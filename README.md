Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/project/66d5b8063947883d20dae14b

There is currently a to-do list in Overleaf. In later stages we can just have it here:

## To-do part a):
- make design matrix for multivariable functions
-  change data generation to generate franke function instead of an exponential function
-  rewrite mse and r2 as our own implementation, not sklearn
-  COMMENT WHAT SCALING WE USED AND WHY
-  fix wonky labeling in parameter plot
